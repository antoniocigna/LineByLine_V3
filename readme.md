Line By Line V3
---------------

This application (which works only on the desktop) is proposed as a tool to improve the understanding of a foreign language.
  
It is possible to request the reading of any text one line at a time, one word at a time or one letter at a time (spelling) and have it repeated as many times as you want at the desired speed. It is possible to listen to the sentences and try to understand without reading the text which is kept hidden and revealed on request. The translation into your own language can be used by copying it from any automatic translator.
  
It has been tested on Microsoft Windows/10 with Microsoft/Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, the software consists only of HTML files and native Javascript.
  
The synthetic voices used can be local or remote. The largest number of voices available is offered by Microsoft Edge, while Firefox uses only the local ones. 

It's possibile make this application run by the golang applicazion **GoHTML_readWrite**, allowing it to use a text file (csv format) as input. 
Please look at inside the "sampleRunUsing_GoHTML_readWrite" folder to have an hint. 

**Version 2 Update**  
- possibility to correct alignment errors between lines in the original language and lines of translation,  
- download of an html file containing the original text, its translation and other settings, by running this file it is possible to perform the proposed exercises without any further request for parameters.
